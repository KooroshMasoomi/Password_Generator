# Password Generator

## This program creates a password for you with the settings you apply.

<hr>

### To set the default password length, you can set the LENGTH variable, which is set to 10 characters by default:

<br>

```python
LENGTH = 10
```

### You can also change the length of the password by entering the file entry:

<br>

```console
Main.py 20
```

<hr>

### To use or not use options such as the presence of lowercase letters in the password, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols, you can confirm or reject each of them, which are set by default as follows:

<br>

```python
UPPERCASE = True

LOWERCASE = False

NUMBERS = True

SYMBOLS = False
```

<hr>

**I suggest that if you want to use this program, put the file in the folder where your terminal starts, hide the file so that the folder is not crowded, finally you can quickly go to the terminal and use the program.**
